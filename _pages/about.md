I am a Deep/Machine learning engineer, I am interested in building applications that have impact on our real-world using the knowledge I have in  NLP, Computer Vision and self-driving cars. The more challenges i face, the more passionate and eager i get to solve them.

Currently, I am pursuing my master's degree at Bielefeld university in intelligent systems.
I am working now on two interesting projects:
- Detecting Depression in social media.
- Monocular visual odometry For Duckie Town competition.


## Experience
### Student Research Assistant at Fraunhofer institute (Germany) (june 2018 - september 2019)
Worked on different research and production tasks including:
- Evaluation of Fuzzy string matching and natural language processing procedures well as implementation of a demonstration for automated word processing with the help of Fuzzy string matching and natural language processing.
- Development of graphical java swing user interface for control and manipulating UML/SysML models.
- Development of QVTO - based model transformation for the transfer of UML/SysML Models to forms of presentation and the development of programmes for the automated creation of UML/SysML diagrams,
-participating in research activities and presenting the research results in events as well as teaching assistant in a company-university projects in context of Model based system engineering.


### Intern at Microsoft AppFactory (Egypt) (October 2016 - June 2017)
- Worked as a technical evangelist by presenting different Microsoft solutions and devices like Azure and Hololens in Microsoft's events.
- Introduce Microsoft solutions to startups(Xamarin, Azure).

## University's projects
### Depression Detection[[github]](https://github.com/noureldinalaa/depression_detector)

-  Dataset used from early risk competition in which they have collected data from users in social media especially Reddit in order to detect depression[[link]](https://early.irlab.org/2018/index.html)
- LSTM , BERT Models used in training.
- Skorch used also to try cross validation.
- Pytorch library used and Spacy used for tokanization.

### Monocular visual odometry for Duckie Town competition(in progress)

- Detecting features from an image and calculate the optical flow between two frames.
- Research area still in progress (create a neural network architecture to calculate instead of using opencv library)
- Pytorch and opencv are used in this project.

### Nod detection using SVM

- SVM model to classify nod or not by feedin it annotated videos with nods.
- Dlib machine learning library used and C++ used.

### Manipulating robot arm (KUKA) using VR Controller (ROS C++)

- Controlling KUKA arm to imitate the same motion as it is receiving from the VR Controller .
- Using ROS (Robotic operating system) to receive the current pose of the KUKA arm  and the VR controller to calculate the twist command.
- Using OROCOS components to control KUKA in real time.

## Udacity's deep learning nanodegree projects

### Face generation[[github]](https://github.com/noureldinalaa/Face_Generation)

- Generate images of new and realistic human faces using CelebA dataset.
- DCGAN(Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks) used for training.
- Pytorch library used.

### Dermatologist-ai[[github]](https://github.com/noureldinalaa/dermatologist-ai)

- Create a model to predict and diagnose skin lesion images as one of three different skin diseases (melanoma, nevus, or seborrheic keratosis).
- Created normal CNN architecture and transfer learning also used, using pretrained model(ResNet and Inception).
- Pytorch used

### TV script generator[[github]](https://github.com/noureldinalaa/TV_Script_Generator)

- Generate a new fake TV script from Seinfeld dataset.
- RNN model used for training.
- Pytorch library used.
